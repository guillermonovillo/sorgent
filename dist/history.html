				Sorgente Group, specializing in the investment and real estate finance sector, has its origins in Italy in 1910 and in the United States in 1919. <br><br>

				In Italy, Sorgente’s work in industrial sectors initially involved precision engineering and building components for post-World War II development, with tenders for big technological plants on behalf of public and private customers. Prominent clients included Synchotron of Frascati, Alfa Romeo in Arese, and the steel mills at Terni. <br><br>

				In the 1970s, Sorgente promoted various real estate and construction initiatives in Italy and abroad. At the end of the 1990s, Valter Mainetti, current principal shareholder of the group, reorganized Sorgente Group. The business now principally operates in the real estate finance sector to carry out investments and set up real estate funds. Sorgente SGR was established with this focus in mind; since 2011 the Group has launched 34 real estate funds.

			<p>
				In the USA, Sorgente’s business activities commenced in 1919, during a period in which it started to develop its own entrepreneurial activities in the real estate sector. It distinguished itself in the New York market through a company specialized in multi-floor iron structures and by participating in the construction of several buildings, including the extension of the New York Stock Exchange in 1923 and the structure of the Chrysler Building in 1928. <br><br>

				Today, Sorgente Group of America has various real estate finance and development initiatives in the US. The development arm has distinguished itself in the real estate world for its extraordinary portfolio and its attention to sustainable development practices. Sorgente’s eco-conscious approach to renovation and construction will lead it into the future around the globe.
