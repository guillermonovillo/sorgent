						<p>Over the years, Sorgente Group of America has had the privilege of investing in some of the nation’s most iconic buildings. Selecting buildings that have historic and architectural relevance has been the core of our philosophy. We feel that preserving and restoring what has already been built is a sustainable, responsible use of resources. Restoration is a value that has the ability to better, not just the buildings, but our neighborhood, our company, the economy as a whole and, ultimately, our environment.</p>

						<img src="img/img-r-filosofia-about.jpg" alt="">
						<p>We take immense enjoyment out of being able to breathe new life into these buildings that, in a way, reinforce much of what we love about this country. It is so incredibly rewarding to be able to save their embodied energy, which together with their cultural significance will only increase with the passage of time.
							<br>I believe that the soul in these great buildings is simply unfathomable. It is this notion, together with the acknowledgement that we will always succeed by selecting such landmark properties, that fuels my passion to continue on this journey.
							<br>
							<br><i>- Sincerely, Veronica Mainetti.</i>
